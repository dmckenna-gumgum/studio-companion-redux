always make sure you ask before committing to massive rewrites of entire components or the architecture of a given tool. If your attempts to implement a given solution fail repeatedly, please consult with me before commiting to a workaround, or an entirely different approach altogether. We should always prefer best pracitces for the given workflow and architectural patterns of the project and anything divergent from that should be discussed prior to implementation.
